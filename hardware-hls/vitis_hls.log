Test 1.1: No packets (all zeros)
✓ Correctly returned invalid

Test 1.2: Single queue (port 5 has 100 packets)
✓ Correctly selected port 5

Test 1.3: Multiple queues (testing distribution)
Distribution over 10000 samples:
  Port 0: 5000 (50%, expected ~50%)
  Port 1: 2500 (25%, expected ~25%)
  Port 2: 2500 (25%, expected ~25%)
✓ Distribution looks correct

========================================
TEST 2: LFSR Random Number Generation
========================================

Test 2.1: Single LFSR step
Seed:   0x0xdeadbeef
Result: 0x0xbd5b7dde
✓ LFSR produces different output

Test 2.2: Check uniqueness over 100 iterations
✓ All 100 values unique
